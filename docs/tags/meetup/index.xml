      <description>Last night I attended a great data science meetup hosted by Enova Decisions in downtown Chicago. Iâ€™ve been to a few other data related meetups that mostly focused on talks or networking, but this one was all based around a challenging data set for participants to delve into.

 I heard word of the Smackdown from the fantastic Chicago R Users Group (RUG) earlier this week and was sure to register as soon as I could.</description>
